        <p>&amp; Hello world. This isn't my first website, but it might as well be.<p>
        <p> My name is Rey, I have just switched over to the ITM program
            from computer science. I am a second year student and would like to learn
            from and about you all.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I think I like HTML and visual web development more than back end
            development, I don't know we'll see.</p>
